[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2abb9cad-3572-4280-8c77-448d6d5e7912/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zambonidev/deploys)

This is an example Next.js project that shows Next.js' upcoming SSG (static-site generation) support using Notion's **private** API for a backend.

**Note**: This example uses the experimental SSG hooks only available in the Next.js canary branch! The APIs used within this example will change over time. Since it is using a private API and experimental features, use at your own risk as these things could change at any moment.

I made some modification to enable this project to be deployable to **Netlify**
